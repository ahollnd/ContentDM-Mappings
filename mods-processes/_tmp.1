               <full-text>June 9, 1936 Dear Folks: In the laundry bag, besides what Bob tells you, also put my old green hat which is in the front closet, some stationery, post cards, envelopes, stamps If you have already sent the bag you had better send them some other way. Send my mail to 22 East Bloomington &amp; my laundry also. Anything of value had better be sent to the Phi Gamma Delta House of which Eckdahl is in charge. The other address would be alright but things are rather disorganized &amp; it might be misplaced. This letter will lack continuity &amp; probably coherence but you'll get some enjoyment from it &amp; can figure out how I am getting along. I don't remember all I said in this morning's letter so I'm apt to repeat some of it. There are many things to be desired. No chance at all to read or study. They don't even take the Des Moines Register. I'll get less sleep per nite than ever before. There are 6 in my room including De Herr of whom two or three pretty nice guys. However I am in the top of a double decker about 2 or 3 ft from the lights &amp; when these birds come in late, each &amp; every one switches on the light. I am getting used to it &amp; will soon be able to sleep right</full-text>

               <full-text>thru. As it is I haven't missed the sleep in the least. As to food. It is fair to good with out much variety. However I might as well get used to the fact that my feet won't be under the home table very often anymore. For crying out loud poke it down George. A year or two ago I would have balked at some of this stuff, but tonight I bolted raisins, tapioca &amp; stewed tomatoes like it was ice cream or upside down cake with whipped cream. I wonder if I'll ever taste the like again. Again I say don't take this too hard. It is the gospel truth but I am enjoying the humorous side of it &amp; it is good experience. Most of these birds seem to thrive on it &amp; like it so I guess I can. Boy you should see these birds eat. I can't describe it in writing but remind me when I see you again &amp; I'll split your sides with laughter. Simmering it all down I am getting used to it except for wiping the supper dishes. Probably before long I won't mind that, wiping dishes for 35 to 40 isn't a great deal of fun. Two other guys help the conditions under which we work is what isn't so good. It is in a small room</full-text>

               <full-text>Beloved: contin'd in the basement with not much air. When it really gets hot it will be swell. However I repeat don't come tearing down here but give me your mental support &amp; everything will work out ok. The first nite which by the way as also the worst meal put me in a depressed mood. I raved on to Bob at quite a tempo. I am glad I didn't dampen his ardor for the whole University. I was never so sure as right now that I want a known quantity of a roommate this fall. It is pretty hard to get anybody to take my place on supper dishes but I am going to try to get to Cedar Rapids this weekend. While I think I better stick this out for 2 or 3 weeks at least, after that I would like to work in Cedar R. if I could make anything. I'll write you what I find out &amp; if that doesn't pan out maybe something in Omaha will. Tell Ben to make &amp; save all he can. If he can get Bob a job threshing somewhere have him do it. It seems to me that I'll have to stay at least 2 or 3 weeks &amp; then</full-text>

As it is I don't know whether I can work, play football &amp; still get my studies, which of course will have to come in the reverse order of importance. It just looks as if I stepped into a fast one this summer. Thousands of boys are doing this &amp; worse every year. The trouble is I think I could have gotten a job this summer &amp; missed this predicament. However I am learning plenty. Several times a day my eyes water when I think of everything we have to be grateful for. The demonstration we had on our moving to Omaha &amp; father's job previous to that is marvelous. When I think of the petty things we griped over the last two years I feel like kicking myself. The best plan for getting thru school from now on will be for me to get that scholarship &amp; keep it up &amp; get a job for the summer outside the U. at which I can make $90 or $100. Start thinking right now for such likelihoods</full-text>

               <full-text>Beloved: if any. Bob could have had a job like mine &amp; stayed at the same place but the mood I was in prompted me to discourage him. Even tho I am getting used to it &amp; feel pretty good tonite I still believe he is better off. Help him in anyway possible to get a job for the rest of the summer or just little odd jobs. Every little bit counts &amp; how I am beginning to realize it. There are 4 to 6 in every room where I am staying &amp; really no more room. Already 1 kid is in staying part of the time in the attic which isn't worth the price. On the other side of the argument if he doesn't make enough to go to school this fall I will feel a little guilty. It's a great life if you don't weaken. I am in the best of health &amp; in good spirits this evening. Eckdahl provides me companionship in the evening whenever I need it so I'll get along. This is a hazy outline of what's going on. I'll be glad when I can talk to you for</full-text>

               <full-text>I know I can entertain you for hours. Tell Geo to swim &amp; have a good time &amp; eat anything &amp; everything for there's no place like the table at home. Tell Ben to throw all the whingers he can &amp; throw in a couple for me because the 1st year of college isn't going to be any time for frivolity that I can see. I would be glad to see pop if he is down in this territory but for gosh sake don't come all dressed up or they'll wonder what I am doing here. Just ask where the Bloomington house is if it's about meal time &amp; if it's during the day I'll be down in a ditch somewhere south of the Union. 12ft ditches are pretty deep Love Nile</full-text>

We will start back on Sunday afternoon so I can probably come out to your place on Sat. nite. If you can arrange to see me before game time - fine; if not be sure &amp; come down to the dressing room afterwards.  We have been working like the very devil. How good we are</full-text>

               <full-text>W. J. Monilaw, usually called "Bill" or "Doc", was a student in Drake U. when Fred Greene Clarke was a student there. They were close friends and contacts between the families were continuous as long as the men lived. Doc was associated with Chicago University for many years. He established and directed the "Camp Highlands" in northern Wisconsin from 1904 until well after 1938. I do not know if the Camp is still operated.                                                                                                                                                                                                       This earliest file of the family correspondence begins with this letter from Nile to George, age 11, while Nile was a counselor at Camp Highlands in the summer of 1938. Nile had spent the previous summer, 1937, (after his Freshman year at Iowa U.) as a counselor in Ossie Solem's camp in Minnesota. Ossie was head coach at Iowa when Nile was a Freshman, just before  Irl Tubbs came to Iowa. NCK. 7-17-'74</full-text>

               <full-text>Camp Highlands ON PLUM LAKE SAYNER, Wisconsin July 18, 1938 Dear George: -  I am so glad to hear that you are having so much fun. There is no place like a small town for a boy to have a fine time during the summer time. I hope you are working on your swimming, diving, tennis, and occasionally some golf. You will want to be proficient at them some day and it doesn't come without a good deal of practice. Are you helping Grandma a little each day? Consideration and helpfulness are great virtues and well worth cultivating. When you go with the [Bices?] - if you have not already gone; I have forgotten</full-text>

We camped there that nite - played bridge with Rollie that evening - paddled across the lake the next morning where a camp truck picked us up. A fine trip &amp; lots of fun.

               <full-text>Ben &amp; father would be ideal. Perhaps sometime we can do it. Tomorrow I go out on a camping trip with a bunch of little snipes which I don't relish very much. But perhaps it will be more fun than I think. My sweatshirt arrived as did also my toothbrush, etc. Thanks very much. I planned to write just as soon as I got back from the trip. I was full of a lot of good things to write then, but since my return I have been busy writing letters to parents at Docs request which has taken up most of my time. Hence, I haven't said as much about the trip as I had planned.</full-text>

Editor-in-chief Carney Denvir Managing editor Bob Carney Hews Editor Perry O'Neil Reporters--Charles Luberger, Tom Goodman, Dennis Kelly, Bob Reid, Henry Malcolm, Roger Conant. Adviser Fred Vance MONDAY, JULY 19, 1937 EDITORIAL Every person at Camp Highlands who saw Wally Anderson's Indian ceremony Saturday night was more than pleased with the performance. The many hours spent by the boys in preparation for the show were well spent because every act went off smoothly and without any interruptions which so frequently go along with an unorganized performance. One of the highlights of the performance was the fact that the players paid no attention to the audience and went on with their acts without that smile on their faces which is the result of seeing a friend in the front row. Without a doubt the audience appreciated Wally's and the boys' work in preparing the show; and will be waiting for another performance in about two weeks.

My letter to the folks about my first canoe trip was  originally intended for you - that is, as I paddled along and saw Nature's interesting things, I naturally thought of you first - however, on my return I decided that since I hadn't written home in quite awhile that my obligation was in their favor. I hope you will accept</full-text>

               <full-text>portaging is much like an army experiences after marching 1/2 day to a certain point then being told they had made a mistake and would have to return over the same road. The second day we portaged to Partridge, across Partridge, up Nixon Creek a little way until it became too shallow and then a portage of a mile and half where we could put in again. Both Bob &amp; I portaged the whole mile &amp; 1/2 without a stop. If you don't think carrying a 90 or 100 lb canoe that far isn't a job your mistaken. While winding up Nixon creek every now and then we would scare up a duck or two. Also in Nixon lake as we laboriously poled our way thru wild rice - about like rowing across a football field in a heavy dew - a duck would occasionally</full-text>

When I am paddling on a beautiful lake or swift running wooded stream enjoying the wonderful things of Nature I envy the early explorers and Indians; I mentally transport myself back to their day and glory in the fun and exhiliration (sp) of it all.

Several herons flapped ponderously ahead of us at different time - much like a heavily loaded transport ship just getting under way. A small flock of ducks kept just ahead of us for several miles. Just a few miles below Eagle River we saw a deer swimming across the river in front of us. We tried to catch up to him before he could gain the shore, but we failed and he disappeared quickly in the underbrush. We stayed our last night on St. Germain Lake. It was a very poor camp site and there was only room for one tent. So we told our "pals" that they could sleep under the flap of our tent. Boy, did they take a beating. The</full-text>

               <full-text>very much ashamed. I hope you'll show her this letter and tell her that I did receive her annual birthday remembrance and will write as soon as I can. Last nite we had the annual camp vaudeville. It was very clever and people from all around the lake came to see it. I was one of 5 huskies dressed in sun suits who did a balloon or bubble dance. If it smelled the way I think it did you will have known about the act via the atmosphere before this letter reaches you.</full-text>

Read it again some day. "The shadow of night were falling fast  As through an Alpine village passed A youth, who bore, mid snow and ice A banner with strange device, - "Excelsior!"  (means higher, ever upward) I interrupt slightly  He went on up the Alpine mountain; was that life? In happy homes he saw the light Of household fires gleam warm and bright, Above the spectral glaciers shone, And from his lips escaped a groan -- "Excelsior!"  (Stop not for the bright, happy homes)  "Try not the Pass! the old man said; Dark lowers the tempest overhead, The roaring torrent is deep and wide" And loud that clarion voice replied -- "Excelsior'!"  Stop not for the tempests and roaring torrents of life  "O stay," The maiden said, "and rest Thy weary head upon this breast"! A tear stood in his bright blue eye, But still he answered, with a sigh -- "Excelsior!"  I must to the peak, I must gain the peak</full-text>

               <full-text>G. W. CLARKE ADEL, IOWA Beware the pine-tree's withered branch Beware the awful avalanche"! This was the peasants' last good-night, A voice replied, far up the height, "Excelsior!" A traveler by the faithful hound,  Half buried in the snow was found, still grasping in his hand of ice That banner with the strange device, - Excelsior! Then in the twilight cold and gray, Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay And from the sky, serene and far, A voice fell, like a falling star, - Excelsior! I have not quoted all the poem -- only parts of it. "Excelsior!" The "youth" was bound to reach the top. Nothing stopped him, nothing could. Nothing did for There in the twilight cold and gray, Lifeless, but beautiful he lay, And from the sky, serene and far, A voice fell like a falling star -- Excelsior! For all such ambitions, all such resolves, all such persistent efforts even against stubborn difficulties - hardships the whole world shouts praise - Excelsior! -- So may it be to you. But we would like to witness the Triumph as it will come to you.  We appreciate very much your sincere thank you for our little gift. with all good wishes we are Grandpa and Grandma.</full-text>

I hope it lets up a little this week for we sure do work hard. I talked to Vogel today &amp; he said ok on $30. That plus the cleaner job should just about take care of current expenses. If I get the gum job I should have a little to spare. Don't forget to rush the agent cards down here as soon as possible.  Yours, Nile</full-text>

               <full-text>September 13th, 1938 Dear Ben: Your first college letter from home will be as brief as your sojourn, to date. When I came in this afternoon Mrs. Long handed me the enclosed keys, saying that they had been picked up from the dining room floor soon after your departure. Believing them to be keys to your or Marney's baggage I hasten to send them on. As I have mentioned heretofore, you will slip easily into a new environment and into a somewhat different manner of living, to which you will adjust yourself readily and will like no end. You are on the threshhold of one of the most interesting and fruitful periods of your life and I know that you will take advantage of all the opportunities, scholastic and social, maintaining the while your very sound foundation of moral and spiritual training. The very best achievements will be yours. Try to keep in touch with Marney during the next few weeks and let me know how she fits herself into the Ames scheme. She impresses me as being self reliant and capable, but she is a long way from home, Bette and Elsie, as well as yourself, will have some of the family dropping in now and then, so it can't get lonesome for you. Please write with as much regularity as seems practicable, even if only a few paragraphs. Fond love Pop</full-text>

               <full-text>245 Fries Avenue  Wilmington Transfer and Storage Company Wilmington, California Saturday Morning Sept. 24  1938. From: C.B.Carter Dear Nile:[Sr] Just a note before starting up to see the U. S.C.- Alabama game. Nile had a bad break last night on one play and because it made a good story the newspapers were not very kind to him. He played a bang up game the rest of the time. The ball was wet so that the passing by both sides was not to good . Iowa's running attack was just as good as U.C.L.A. but Iowa seemed to be lame on the ends on defense. Nile saved two or three touchdowns with his splendid defensive work.  I could not tell just what the trouble was on this one play but it seemed to me that Nile did not know that he was in the end zone when he intercepted that pass. It seemed to be such a surprise to him to see where he was that he didn't know what to do till it was to late.  Five years from now he will get a laugh when he remembers it.  I have not been able to see him yet. I could not get in the dressing room last night but perhaps I will see him at the game today. Very truly, Nick. There are more clippings at home which I will send later.</full-text>

               <full-text>Sept. 26, 1938 from cousin W B Kinnick: Piedmont, Cal. Dear Nile: [Sr.] Well,  the  football game was played as  scheduled and we  saw it likewise.    The  trip wasn't as  strenuous as we had anticipated,  john and I alternating at the wheel. Dad spent most of the  time stretched out behind, and I really think he got  more sleep while on the trip than he would had he not gone. Our seats were excellent, perfect in fact,  smack on the 50-yard line. John wired Dick Macy we would be down and through some mixup Dick got an extra ticket with his party,  so John sat with Dick,  Jack Frush,  their gals and Harry Macy on the other side of the field. I saw D ick and Jack, but missed Harry.    Dick is   selling cars for his papa,  Jack is  a dentist in Burbank, and Harry is  still in the finance business, and, according to John,  looks very good. 1 don't believe  the game gave me a bit bigger thrill than bumping into Nile in the lobby of his hotel before the game.   He's sure a swell looking kid. We waited over an hour to see him and weren't even sure we  could manage  it  then, Tubbs having turned us down cold,  saying the boys were being refused visitors until after the game. We waylaid him however when he came down for supper, and had a very satisfying visit. We  certainly regretted the necessity of returning to Piedmont that night,  since he was  to be free part of  Saturday. We hammered. on the dressing room door after the game as  long as we dared. I hope Dick Macy managed to get hold of him Saturday.    He was anxious  to see him at  closer range. The game  itself was a good one and I'm glad we  saw it. The second half was painful, needless  to  say. Nile was out all of the 3rd quarter too. The biggest disappointment about the whole thing was that Nile wasn't called on enough. The  Iowa fullback did practically all the punting and passing,  and did a mediocre job on most of it,  several  of his passes being cleanly intercepted. I'm damned if   I can figure out Tubbs'   strategy in handing over such an assignment to Balacs,  or whatever his   name is. It's all right to confuse the opponents,   I suppose, but Balaca did so much of it the confusion element was dulled. Nile did some  splendid running early in the game, and did a lot of work at safety. UCLA would have scored heavier if Nile hadn't made  some nice tackles  from his last-ditch position. As  I recall, the last play of the game would have been a touchdown if Hile hadn't forcibly embraced a ball  carrier with a clear field ahead. Eicherly performed very nicely the quarter he replaced Nile.Personally, I'd like to see them in the backfield at the  same time. T he team has a lot  of weight as  it  is, but  I'd like  to see them sacrifice  some weight for speed and shiftiness. Incidentally,  Iowa's ends were terrible. Give Iowa a couple  of ends, and Eicherly to work with Nile, and Iowa would go places. A lady from Iowa City had the seat next to Dad. Said she had driven out to see the game. When Dad informed her he was Nile's uncle  she began,  or rather resumed, a glowing speech of  Nile's  virtues and remarkable reputation on the campus. That was a cue for me to pull the three pictures you sent from an inside pocket. She Oh'd and Ah'd over them, passed them finally to her neighbor, who  in turned passed them to his, and they went a long,  long ways before being finally returned.    A lot of Iowa people   in our section, quite a few of  them Legionnaires. A sailor sat behind us,  rebuking the negro Washington and praising Iowa. The news about  the corn crop was  encouraging.     I wish the price were as  good,    We'll look forward to hearing more about the land, Nile and yourself. Sincerely yours, Bill</full-text>

When Dad informed her he was Nile's uncle  she began,  or rather resumed, a glowing speech of  Nile's  virtues and remarkable reputation on the campus. That was a cue for me to pull the three pictures you sent from an inside pocket. She Oh'd and Ah'd over them, passed them finally to her neighbor, who  in turned passed them to his, and they went a long,  long ways before being finally returned.    A lot of Iowa people   in our section, quite a few of  them Legionnaires. A sailor sat behind us,  rebuking the negro Washington and praising Iowa. The news about  the corn crop was  encouraging.     I wish the price were as  good,    We'll look forward to hearing more about the land, Nile and yourself. Sincerely yours, Bill</FULLTEXT>

               <full-text>September 9, 1938 Dear SB: Mother wrote you a day or so ago and I had intended to do so before this, but allowed other activities to intervene. We have been expecting word from you also. Your wire was received, and the papers mentioned that you were limping. Trust that you will realize the importance of keeping quiet, or at least avoiding further strain until a healing is effected, I was in Centervllle last Friday and listened to the game, which had a couple of surprises. First, your mildly famous play at the close of the first half; second, the let down of the Iowa team or the astonishing improvement of the UCLA outfit. We hoped for victory, but would have been philosophical over a margin of one or two touchdown loss. However, it is all over and the only gain to be had is to bolster up the weak places and to profit by the mistakes made and demonstrate that Iowa can play just as smart and just as tough football as Wisconsin or any other Big Ten, team. Your catch of the pass behind the goal was puzzling, but I knew there must be some explantion as it is not like you to be so far off in your execution. I had a letter from Nick Carter written Saturday morning in which he guessed the reason, and said, "1 could not,tell just what the trouble was on this play but it seemed to me that Nile did not know that he was in the end zone when he intercepted that pass. It seemed to be such a surprise to him to see where he was that he didn't know what to do until It was too late. Five years from now he will laugh when he remembers it." His analysis proved to be correct, except that instead of five years, I suggest that you make it five days, unless you have already decreased that time. It isn't that important. Nick also said, "He played a bang up game the rest of the time. Iowa's running attack was just as good as UCLAs but Iowa seemed weak at the ends on defence. Nile saved two or three touchdowns with his splendid defensive work." Along this line, I have just had a letter from Aunt Mary, and one paragraph says, "Just heard a sport broadcast between Tiny Thornhlll and some sports writer and Tiny said Kinnick was the only outstanding player on Iowa (s team." So don't let your tail droop because of that one play, and I am sure, that your sense of proportion will properly catalog the incident as one from which to take a lesson, and nothing more. I shall be anxious to learn if you saw Butler, Bill and Johnny, or Nick Carter. Mrs. McCord has sent us a couple of notes and enclosed some clippings, saying that Harry, Glendora and Florence had gone up to the game and hoped to see you. You must have had a fine trip, altho I realize that usually the team is too much confined to see much else than the train, hotel, bus to the field, and back again. Your little excursions this time seem to be an exception. All last week I put in fertilizer plots on farms in Southern Iowa, as far east as Davis County; also on grandma's farm in Dallas Co. and on our farm at Turin. Reached home on Sunday evening. After two days in the office, I am taking 3½ days vacation this week, mostly devoted to renovating the lawn, both front and back. Wonderful time - wish you were here. Expect to go back to Adel Friday afternoon to spend Sat and Sun looking after the farms. Very likely will be back in So. Iowa in another week or two, but do not know how far east I shall get. I should see Ben on Sunday. Enclosed are three letters that will be of interest and will you please return them, as I am filing them. George's team beat Washington School 31 to 6 last night, and I took some action pictures, which should be revealing if the light was strong enough for high speed. Love     Pop</full-text>

As I hope you have already have guessed I am not in the least downhearted or discouraged. I suppose that most of all I am surprised - surprised that after all these years - a veteran, practically - that I didn't rise to the occasion when the "chips" were down, when so many of my friends were there to see me. Well, it was another experience - an experience out of which I should gain much. So we will let it ride at that.

               <full-text>the scrapbook is to give a true picture the bottom as well as the top should be shown. I enjoyed very much the letters from Ben and Gene you forwarded. Evidently everything is working out very nicely for him. It is no doubt gratifying to you, father, that he pledged Beta - even tho the rest of us would rather be in hell than a Beta Theta Pi. I was interested and happily pleased to hear - from the tenor of his letter - that Ben was not fooled by the sham and false front of rush week nor did he let it color his true picture of fraternity life. I am sure he has made a good decision and that</full-text>

I believe we can win, but something always seems to come up. I guess I am going to start calling signals again - which I do want to do. If they'll just let me do more of the passing I"ll feel rarin' to go. Well its a great life if you don't weaken - and I'm not planning to weaken - are you.

               <full-text>To C B Carter October 3rd,  1938. Dear Nick: Thanks a lot for your letter and the clippings, the second consignment of which came today. When a game turns out like that one, a single item is about all that is necessary, but the note that you struck In your letter is ringing louder all the time. You remarked that in five years Nile would get a laugh on remembering this game. We  have already laughed alot about it, and while Nile's first letter after returning was only expressive of his keen disappointment in the teams showing, including his own, another received today indicates that he too is seeing the comic side and again has his tail in the air. If they can manage to win from Wisconsin, Which now appears highly improbable. I believe that Iowa might do very well this fall. If they should lose again, badly, I fear that the blow will be hard to recover from. But football isn't everything, thank the Lord, and if we can keep the kids from forgetting that, the college career can still be a success. Ames didn't cut much ice 25 years ago, and I have always been glad that we were up there and have never apologized to anyone for the institution. I believe that I told you Ben is at Ames this fall as a Freshman, in General Engineering. He is rooming in a private house with another lad from Omaha, and both of them have pledged Beta and are taking their meals at the house.  Sunday, yesterday, I stopped in Ames and had a brief visit with Ben. He thinks it is a swell place, and well he should. The largest Freshman in history of all Iowa colleges has enrolled, and the total registered student body is said to be about 6500. Ben says that there are three boys named Buffington from Glenwood in the chapter, at least two of whom are Freshman if I remember correctly. They would be some of your clan I reckon. Thanks again, Nick, and with kindest regards I am Yours in -kai- [Nile Kinnick, Sr]</full-text>

               <full-text>my tail warmed. I am sure this is really part of college life. The only drawback is finding time &amp; determination to study. Sunday Bob &amp; I went to 3 sorority open houses along with most of the other fellows. I wish you could have seen me balancing tea cups, asking for two lumps of sugar in my coffee, etc. It was a real rat race - great fun - if you like it - and I did for the moment - why not. I met some pretty nice girls and will get around socially a little more this year, I hope. Ralph Ross stopped in to see us Sun. nite on his way home</full-text>

            <FULLTEXT>my tail warmed. I am sure this is really part of college life. The only drawback is finding time &amp; determination to study. Sunday Bob &amp; I went to 3 sorority open houses along with most of the other fellows. I wish you could have seen me balancing tea cups, asking for two lumps of sugar in my coffee, etc. It was a real rat race - great fun - if you like it - and I did for the moment - why not. I met some pretty nice girls and will get around socially a little more this year, I hope. Ralph Ross stopped in to see us Sun. nite on his way home</FULLTEXT>

               <full-text>October 5th, 1938 Dear SB: Enclosed is check for $30.00 which may be placed in your reserve. You said in a recent letter that you are fixed alright for finances but did not go into details. I do not know that you have any deposit in the Postal Savings, and perhaps you would rather put this in your account in the Omaha National. If it will help you meet current expenses yon will want to keep it with you. You have never mentioned the gum connection and we have wondered if anything came of it?  When you have time give a little more detail on your finances and the prospects, of the dry cleaning income. I have justt sent Ben a check for $50.oo. His expenses will be in the neighborhood of $45 per month, which I believe does not include small personal expenses. Ben looks after the little items pretty well, however. I have suggested that he keep his eyes open for boardjob s  that might be available a little later in the year after he get himself well established in his studies. I saw Ben briefly last Sunday afternoon on my way home from Franklin County. His algebra was tough to  start, but he is getting into it better. Chem is also hard. His roommate is a shark in it, and was an A student at Central. The Bank has cut me off on driving my own car, so hereafter I shall be using a Bank car. That means selling the coupe, which I hope to get done before long, and should realize close to $400 if the right party shows up. Such a sum will put you boys thru the rest of the school year without any trouble. On Friday morning I am starting for South Dakota to be gone about a week, as far northwest as Mobridge and Lemmon, both of which towns you may remember as being on your trip to Seattle, both along the northern border of the state. The pheasant and duch season is open up there and Lewis Halverson, a native of the state, has a license and a gun and some shells.

            <FULLTEXT>October 5th, 1938 Dear SB: Enclosed is check for $30.00 which may be placed in your reserve. You said in a recent letter that you are fixed alright for finances but did not go into details. I do not know that you have any deposit in the Postal Savings, and perhaps you would rather put this in your account in the Omaha National. If it will help you meet current expenses yon will want to keep it with you. You have never mentioned the gum connection and we have wondered if anything came of it?  When you have time give a little more detail on your finances and the prospects, of the dry cleaning income. I have justt sent Ben a check for $50.oo. His expenses will be in the neighborhood of $45 per month, which I believe does not include small personal expenses. Ben looks after the little items pretty well, however. I have suggested that he keep his eyes open for boardjob s  that might be available a little later in the year after he get himself well established in his studies. I saw Ben briefly last Sunday afternoon on my way home from Franklin County. His algebra was tough to  start, but he is getting into it better. Chem is also hard. His roommate is a shark in it, and was an A student at Central. The Bank has cut me off on driving my own car, so hereafter I shall be using a Bank car. That means selling the coupe, which I hope to get done before long, and should realize close to $400 if the right party shows up. Such a sum will put you boys thru the rest of the school year without any trouble. On Friday morning I am starting for South Dakota to be gone about a week, as far northwest as Mobridge and Lemmon, both of which towns you may remember as being on your trip to Seattle, both along the northern border of the state. The pheasant and duch season is open up there and Lewis Halverson, a native of the state, has a license and a gun and some shells. He feels confident that we can get some fowls, and my mouth is already watering. We plan to freeze some birds and bring them home. We'll see how that turns out. The papers report that your ankle still bothers  you, tho your letter said that it was coming along fine. I hope that you will not be obliged to perform very long if it really is al all unfit. I take no pleasure in having any boy in a tough game of football when he is not tip-top. It seems more natural to see you on the signal calling, passing and kicking assignment. Power to you.

It is a grand game, but not everything by any manner of calculation. Do the very best you can but don't let the results, either glorious  triumph or stunning defeat, push you off balance.

               <full-text>October 5th, 1938 Dear SB, My other letter written to-day was typed at the office during noon hour, before I had seen your long letter which came to-day and before I had seen the Register. Mother's eyes were shining when I came home this aft and when I had read your letter we both rejoiced, and I couldn't help remarking, as I have done before, that things don't just happen but come about because of preparation. If you hadn't laid the foundation by a good many years of studious and conscientious work, you wouldn't have come to the minds of those men who asked you to come and see them this week. Most emergencies find some man or woman available to meet the need, but it isn't just because they happen to be near at hand. They rise to the top at such times because they have been prepared and are equipped to do the job that the emergency requires. A person can't suddenly become honest, tactful, patient, calm or technical, just because a sudden need arises. Those are skills that must be cultivated by practice just like the ability to pass and kick a football, and I suspect that you feel grateful that your 20 years have included a few serious thoughts and a certain amount of studied preparation. When there are more details available, please let us have them. The Register to-day indicates a bit more optomism in the Iowa camp.  I know that you will do all you can to keep the spark alive, and certainly it must be an intangible quality that is lacking' a belief in a victory. Nothing succeeds like success is a saying that has a lot of active force in it and the opposite can have a deadly effect.  I can't see why you can't supply that necessary leadership. I really believe that you ought to practice that "skill"' with greater earnestness. There is a real need, and someone will have to fill it. What an opportunity for every chap on that Iowa squad. It would appear that everything is about ripe for your outfit to catch fire, and a victory next Saturday could be the spark.  I hope you don't use the pressure so much in the first half that there will be none left for the second, which has seemed to be the case in somany Iowa games. That can be changed, and it must be your turn to put the fireworks under the other outfit during the second half. While we are on the subject of skills, comfort and poise and graciousness in a sorority house parlor doesn't come in a single afteroon. Maybe after football season is past it might pay to lay a few bricks in the foundation of the future along that line. Enclosed is a receipt for another dividend from the Adel State Bank. If you will sign it where indicated, I assume that the Receiver will send you a check for like amount. The other boys and mother have      returned theirs. Fondest love and expectations Pop No 4 in row or golf since you left; too busy.</full-text>

               <full-text>October 13. 1938. Dear S.B. On my return home last evening from the trip into South Dakota it waa very, ver y good to read your letter written last Sunday night. Your sane and stabilized view point gives great comfort to us and we rejoice that a situation that has become trying, to say the least, finds you with a calm spirit and a natural response to place the importance of things in their proper order. I did not learn of the outcome of the Wisconsin game until Sunday evening and did not read an account of it until I saw a Sioux City paper on Monday in Sioux Falls. You see I have been away up in the far corner of South Dakota, and lucky to be within sight of civilization at all. From what I have read I would believe that Wisconsin was plain lucky on two or three of their scores. The fact that Iowa came back for two earned touchdowns after being scored on several times, suggests that the Iowa showing was not as bad as the score would indicate. Someone remarked that to me as I came in the bank this morning also. But they still pay off in touchdowns and it is hard to find much consolation in anything lees than the larger end of the score. I should like to sit in with you on a discussion of the situation. It certainly must be something that doesn't appear on the surface. But whatever it is, I know that you will have done your own best, and considerable satisfaction goes with that. Looking ahead, I suppose that you will feel some obligation and desire to come back again next year for your last season of competition. instead of taking the Rhodes - if it is available. I don't know that I blame you for that, and possibly a lot of other followers of Iowa would be disappointed if you did not return, and wonder if the Iowa fortunes of the past two years had any influence. If you are to return, cannot some foundation be started right now this, year for a nucleus of genuinely interested and talented boys who really will build a moral at Iowa for victory instead of the defeatist attitude that had been prevailing. There isn't time to enlarge on this theme, as I am writing during the noon hour in prder that this might get to you before you leave for Chicago. You should win that game unless there is a complete breakdown. So get in there and help turn the ca rt around and who can say that a victory over Chicago isn't all that is needed to make a very decent showing the rest of the season. Best of everything, and I will try to make a better showing on the letter writing next week. Blessings on Mrs. Winneke for her very kind and thoughtful invitaion last Saturday night. It was just what you wanted and needed, wasn't it. Love pop</full-text>

               <full-text>[Oct. 16, 1938] Sunday Dear Mother: - Well we finally won one although not in a very impressive manner. However, to win, even from Chicago is something. I didn't injure my ankle any further, but I wasn't able to dodge and cut yesterday as I should. After church today I went out to Mrs. Wienecke's for lunch again. Before I left she said it came to her that Jacob also wrestled with his thigh  (ankle) and he received an idea and would not let it go till it blessed him; admonishing me to hang to my good idea likewise. That sounds good to me and I shall hang on. Again</full-text>

               <full-text>it seems my work is done but the belief attempts to linger although it is better each day. I suspect I saw 25 or 30 people I knew after the game yesterday. There were camp kids by the dozen; Bob Merriam, Bill Macy, Les Dohr, Doe Monilaw, Harlan Wilson, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Buck, etc. Also Mr. and Mr. Egloff came down to the game, bless them, and took me out to dinner and show afterwards. One's friends are a constant source of joy. I also ran into a young fellow by the name of Bittner who was a Beta at Ames when you were still quite active in fraternity affairs</full-text>

               <full-text>2 Well as far as I am concerned neither Iowa nor Nile Kinnick has been whipped by error yet - nor will they be. I am grateful that there has been little publicity of my injury - that my mind has not been able to hang any excuses  on me for a poor showing. Help me to handle the belief that the Iowa team play &amp; spirit is dependent on my being able to go at top speed. I wish so fervently that we could get going for the coaches sake - they are as fine a bunch as ever lived. The papers and wolves are after them hot and heavy - the rats. Oh well, enough of this. Stay by me in culminating a fine demonstration.</full-text>

            <FULLTEXT>2 Well as far as I am concerned neither Iowa nor Nile Kinnick has been whipped by error yet - nor will they be. I am grateful that there has been little publicity of my injury - that my mind has not been able to hang any excuses  on me for a poor showing. Help me to handle the belief that the Iowa team play &amp; spirit is dependent on my being able to go at top speed. I wish so fervently that we could get going for the coaches sake - they are as fine a bunch as ever lived. The papers and wolves are after them hot and heavy - the rats. Oh well, enough of this. Stay by me in culminating a fine demonstration.</FULLTEXT>

               <full-text>I should come out a bigger, better man in every respect - including football. Last nite the Phi Psis had their hard times party and a little Nelco was in there "swinging it." We started off with a hayride and danced afterwards. All a lot of fun. I had a date with a pretty darn nice girl - a Hawkeye beauty queen last year, to be exact. She invited me to the Delta Gamma party next Sat. nite - so I guess my social debut is inaugurated with a bang. Rah, rah for the college boys. I am in need of my jacket and will soon need my overcoat, maybe. Better send them down one of these days.</full-text>

               <full-text>October 24, 1938 Dear SB: Another fine letter from you this morning, exhibiting a splendid spirit in the face of certain adversity. Your unflinching confidence that victory is certain and close at hand is the sort that makes for victory and will sooner or later set fire to others who lack the vision, I do not refer alone to football wins. They are of passing importance. I mean those steps which day by day are proving the Principle that you are building on. Blessings on you little man, and you may be sure that the steady building of your foundations, as evidenced in your letters this fall, have been the very greatest comfort to your mother and me. Last night mother found your new picture in the laundry, and was almost overcome. We wondered about the occasion for having it taken, and you made no mention of it in yout letter. We like it, tho there is a something around the mouth that doesn't quite ring the bell. Otherwise an excellent picture and one that will please us daily. You will be surprised at the similarity to one of mine that still adorns mother's bureau. Mother, George and I were at Ames for the Homecoming last Saturday, and it was everything that a Homecoming should be. I rode over to Ames Friday afternoon with Ton Oldham etux, in order to attend a football dinner that evening. Mother, Grandma and George came over to Adel Friday aft, and on to Ames Saturday morning, bringing Aunt Kate too. I had a good visit with Ben Friday night, tho Mother had. no opportunity for a like tete-a-tete. During both days I saw more old friends than I have seen in all, the years since leaving the college. And the win over Kansas made it just about perfect. It was so cold on Saturday that we nearly froze in the stands. Mother had brought Be0's heavy jacket and cap, and with her new coat and some blankets we sat thru all of it. Sat evening back to Adel and home Sunday eve. We saw Elsie and Marney, but not Bett. Marney will be Adel for Thanksgiving, as someone probably has written you. Your winetr coat and gray top-coat, together with your jacket are coming over in two packages, starting to-night. Muffler also, but we didn't find any gloves. If you do not have them with you, give us your best guess on their whereabouts. I am going up to Brookings with Stewart and Michaels next Thursday aft, and will be back Saturday morning; a meeting with some of the Extension men on farm management areas of the state. A similar meeting at Ames on the 2lst of November. Will be at Holdrege, Nebraska on the 3rd, and at Des Moines on the 8th, attending some pasture meetings; that is, meetings to discuss pasture problems. When you know what your plans will be for Thanksgiving, let us know; Mother may have written to you about that. I have a new suit; mother a new heavy sport coat,and hat. The coat is just like a man's and I figured it might fit me, but the shoulders are too narrow and it buttons on the left. Your mom looks very smart in it, George's new shoes are just my fit, and are about the only break I have had in the clothing exchange line since you and Ben began to wear my stuff. We three are going down to hear John Randall Dunn at the Paramount - lecturing, not playing, tonight. Love pop Love Pop</full-text>

Fay Emmetsburg,  Iowa Dear Mr.  Fay: The Iowa-Purdue game, while not a win by the scoreboard, was a distinct satisfaction in that Iowa played a really fine game of football and I wish to add my note to the many that you must be receiving in appreciation of your part in helping those boys find themselves.  I believe that you will be interested in the comment that Nile made in his letter to us written soon after the game, as follows: "To-day Iowa played a ball game - a REAL ball game. We fought hard, played hard for sixty minutes and had a whee of a time. We  tackled hard, blocked hard and did everything but win. Our line whipped their line to a fair-you-well, the same line that held Minnesota for four downs on the 1 foot line and three or four times held Minnesota inside the ten yard line, the same line that tied Fordham. "Before the game, Jimmy Fay of Emmetsburg, gave us a little talk, and he hit the nail on the head. He voiced just exactly the sentiments that I have been trying to get across since I came down here. He said, 'This University will be here for years to come. There always will be alumni and newspapers, but you guys don't owe them-the state, the university, the alumni, the student body-One Damn Thing! You are not obligated in any way to them; you have no responsibility apart from doing your very best. The tradition of IOWA FIGHTS was exemplified by Nanny Pape, Glasgow, Kutch and others. They played to win because that was the object; they gave all they had for the fun of it. So let the papers and the alumni blow off. Pay no attention to them and go out and play the game that you know you are capable of playing.' " "It was like manna from heaven and we went out and played alert agressive football. Football to be proud of! Out of these trying times IOWA is going to emerge on a sound foundation." While the stinging criticism of the past few weeks may have been warranted in some degree I hope that your constructive example of stimulating support will be immediately and earnestly followed by more of the Iowa alumni. Your encouragement certainly was appreciated by one boy and I have been impelled to write you because of it. Yours very truly Nile Kinnick Sr.</full-text>

               <full-text>October 31, 1938 Dear SB. Very pleased to have your letter of Saturday night. The game that afternoon was quite alright and bespeaks of future games that will spell victories in capital letters. Mother and I sat on a hill over the river in Hummell park and listened to the game with considerable pleasure. I believe that I shall write a note to JimmyFay. He gave the team just the sort of support that is needed, didn't he? I hope that the rest of good guys among the alumni will shed their wolf skins and really get in and pitch. I have heard some hard remarks about the shifting in lineups that Tubbs has been making all season, but Saturdays combination seemed to help a lot. But the conviction of victory is the transformation that is now emerging. Power to all of you. Glad to hear that you had no more bumps on the ankle. Enclosed is the twenty bucks, l  am sure that we shall make it alright this year. I havent yet sold the coupe but that will be done in due time. Tomorrow I am driving it again for the Bank on a trip into Ringgold County , where I shal be the rest of this week. From there I will drive to Adel on Saturday and to Franklin County on Sunday. Shall probably see Ben briefly on Sunday, I have been intending to write you about this for acouple of weeks, but it has slipped me. Grandma showed me a letter from Uncle Fred in which he mused on why you have not answered letters from him and Ted. You should do so at once and explain the delay, taking pains not to neglect your correspondence again, even if your replys are brief. People sometimes misunderstand such situations, which I long ago found out to my sorrow. This has been a rather busy weekend for us, as Jay Miles Earr and a young friend from Ames spent Saturday find Sunday with us while their parents attended an amateur radio operators convention; at least the men attended the convention while the women shopped, etc. Just as they were leaving, about six o'clock Sunday evening, the Bice family drove up and stayed until about 8:30, partaking of the festive waffles with us. In the afternoon mother and I took a drive over to Council Bluffs and visited the new Lewis and Clark memorial erected on the bluffs north of CB. It affords the lovliest view that we have seen this year, and was well worth the time. Mother intends taking Mrs. Weaver and Mrs. Davies over there next Thursday, and our trip was the preliminary survey so she will not wander from the beaten path, which really is quite tortuous. Not much word from Ben lately, except to complain that he has been shorted on his laundry lately. In about 3½ weeks we shall meet again for Thanksgiving and I fancy that the meeting will be to the point. Possibly mother has written something coming home to Omaha rather than to Adel, but I believe she has expressed her wish rather than a decision. I understand that you will say if you wish us to come down for a game. With only Nebraska on the home list, there is little choice, but I should enjoy seeing you beat them as much as any. George tells us that he hears that last year the folks at Lincoln wanted to take down the "Sower" from atop the capitol spire and put up Biff Jones. This year they mearly want to take down the "Sower" and Biff Jones. Love pop</full-text>

            <FULLTEXT>October 31, 1938 Dear SB. Very pleased to have your letter of Saturday night. The game that afternoon was quite alright and bespeaks of future games that will spell victories in capital letters. Mother and I sat on a hill over the river in Hummell park and listened to the game with considerable pleasure. I believe that I shall write a note to JimmyFay. He gave the team just the sort of support that is needed, didn't he? I hope that the rest of good guys among the alumni will shed their wolf skins and really get in and pitch. I have heard some hard remarks about the shifting in lineups that Tubbs has been making all season, but Saturdays combination seemed to help a lot. But the conviction of victory is the transformation that is now emerging. Power to all of you. Glad to hear that you had no more bumps on the ankle. Enclosed is the twenty bucks, l  am sure that we shall make it alright this year. I havent yet sold the coupe but that will be done in due time. Tomorrow I am driving it again for the Bank on a trip into Ringgold County , where I shal be the rest of this week. From there I will drive to Adel on Saturday and to Franklin County on Sunday. Shall probably see Ben briefly on Sunday, I have been intending to write you about this for acouple of weeks, but it has slipped me.

               <full-text>October 31,  1938 Mr. James W. Fay Emmetsburg,  Iowa Dear Mr. Fay: The Iowa-Purdue game, while not a win by the scoreboard, was a distinct satisfaction in that Iowa played a really fine game of football and I wish to add my note to the many that you must be receiving in appreciation of your part in helping those boys find themselves. I believe that you will be interested in the comment that Nile made in his letter to us written soon after the game, as follows: "To-day Iowa played a ball game - a REAL ball game. We fought hard, played hard for sixty minutes and had a whee of a time. We tackled hard, blocked hard and did everything but win. Our line whipped their line to a fair-you-well, the same line that held Minnesota for four downs on the 1 foot line and three or four times held Minnesota inside the ten yard line, the same line that tied Fordham. "Before the game, Jimmy Fay of Emmetsburg, gave us a little talk, and he hit the nail on the head. He voiced just exactly the sentiments that I have been trying to get across since I came down here. He said, 'This University will be here for years to come. There always will be alumni and newspapers, but you guys don't owe them-the state, the university, the alumni, the student body-One Damn Thing! You are not obligated in any way to them; you have no responsibility apart from doing your very best. The tradition of IOWA FIGHTS was exemplified by Nanny Pape, Glasgow, Kutch and others. They played to win because that was the object; they gave all they had for the fun of it. So let the papers and the alumni blow off. Pay no attention to them and go out and play the game that you know you are capable of playing.' " "It was like manna from heaven and we went out and placed alert agressive football. Football to be proud of! Out of these trying times IOWA is going to emerge on a sound foundation." While the stinging criticism of the past few weeks may have been warranted in some degree I hope that your constructive example of stimulating support will be immediately and earnestly followed by more of the Iowa alumni. Your encouragement certainly was appreciated by one boy and I have been impelled to write you because of it. Yours very truly Nck</full-text>

               <full-text>JAMES W. FAY LAWYER Emmetsburg, Iowa November 2nd, 1938. Mr. Nile Kinnick, 5024 Hamilton, Omaha, N E B R. Dear Mr. Kinnick: Your beautiful letter leaves me weak.  Of all the fine letters and wires I have received, yours is worthy of framing.  It was an extremely fine gesture, and I shall not forget it. The publicity given me was so great as to make me shrink.  What little I did, was done for those kids, and I am fearful lest someone might think it was done for personal glory. I felt when I went into that dressing room that these boys were hungry, desperately hungry and eager for a word of encouragement and confidence from the outside.  To them, I poured out all of the loyalty that fiercely burns inside, and what a response! I will never forget the way they came up to their own, nor the wonderful way they treated me in the dressing room, after the game.  It was a small riot. Nor will I ever forget what Nile said:  "Where have you been all our lives?" I told him around, and he then said "Don't ever leave us, please, for we need you". What a vote of confidence from a really wonderful boy.  All of the squad were the same way. The Editor of the Iowan came into the dressing room to make his peace.  Some of the boys were inclined not to shake hands with him, and I did a little work as peacemaker.  Surrounded by a group of boys, I told him, "John Mooney, I don't care what your fight is with the athletic department, but please don't crucify these boys anymore.  We got them here, and we are responsible for them. Stick with them until November 19th, then dip your pen in vitrol if you wish".  He turned to me, shook hands, and said "Okay, I'll play ball". Confidentially, Nile is the one boy on the squad I was worried about.  A brilliant student, analytical and developed mentally way beyond his years, I thought that he might say to himself "Who is this bird, coming in here to attempt to coke me up?"</full-text>

               <full-text>Mr. Nile Kinnick, Omaha, Nebr., November 2nd, 1938, Page Two. Such was not my intent, at least not in the thought of so many silly dressing room speeches that are an insult to a boy's intelligence. What pleased me, so very much, was the fact that Nile was the FIRST boy there to show response.  I knew after the first 30 seconds that I was talking his language.  His subsequent statements and the letter proved me to be right. I need not tell you how wonderful I think this boy of yours is. My talk to the boys at Minneapolis is to be different.  In the main it is to be directed directly at the boys, calling them by name, and is to be given with the full staff, and some of the loyal team boosters there.  If these kids need another vote of confidence, they are going to get a real one. In confidence, here is the tribute that I am going to pay to that boy of yours.  I'm going to stop in front of his mat, and say: "Nile Kinnick, you came back into your own last Saturday. You were the boy of last year when you reached the heights, and from now on, with that flaming courage of yours, there isn't a team in the United States that can stop you".   That is not a part of a "canned" dressing room speech.  I wouldn't make one of them, if I could. It will come from the bottom of my heart, to a mighty swell boy. I do not know how I can ever express my real appreciation over this letter. It is so fine, that you makeme deeply and humbly grateful. Very truly yours, James W Fay JAMES W. FAY JWF-H.</full-text>

Bob &amp; I were initiated without mishap and are now brothers in the bond. The tea was pretty much a success and even I entered into the spirit of it. Sat. nite I had a good time at the Delta Gamma party, also. The above makes it sound as if everything were "hunky-dory." Well "mebbe so and mebbe not."

               <full-text>2 I do not intend to miss them any longer. My future and present are not dependent on material success and accomplishment but a spiritual development. If leading a normal, correct college life seems to discredit or diminish worldly accomplishment  (grades) I can't keep - it is no cause for apprehension. This football deal has me just about at the end of my string. Even in the Purdue game I wasn't able to give out all I had. I didn't think I got banged up, but by golly last nite Tues (my 1st nite out for practice this week)</full-text>

               <full-text>cooperation from me. As I write this I have a twinkle in my eye, a song in my heart. I feel rested, at peace. Despite a seemingly poor start this shall be a fruitful year for me yet. I am going to have the time and money to see some plays, go to concerts and lectures. The junior year is often the turning point for college students who are working their way thru and who have no job (certain) waiting for them after graduation. I can see it is in the boys on the squad and in contact with the other students.</full-text>

               <full-text>[Nov. 14, 1938] Mon. - 5:30 P:M. Dear Family, The game at Indiana was a heartbreaker. The boys fought harder than I have ever seen them. It was hot and it seemed as if they were on our goal line all afternoon. But we dug in and held them time after time. We hung on even tho we were all so tired we could hardly move. After getting that field goal we thought surely we had them beaten - and then by golly they scored on one their many passes. I played the only real game P have played all year - blocked and tackled with a reckless abandon and ran spontaneously and unhampered whenever necessary.</full-text>

               <full-text>How good it felt. This week I should be ready to make up in some measure the poor game I played against Nebr. last year. There is little doubt in my mind that the reign of Ira Tel is at an end. Personally, I believe it is best for him and all concerned. He is fighting a losing battle - he just isn't the man for this job contrary to what I thought at first. I would like very much to see Ernie or Pat take over - they both understand the situation down here now and both are good coaches and would use a single - wing back - however,  it is difficult to see how such a step could come about.</full-text>

               <full-text>next years team if possible? - relative to the statement above and probable necessity of spring practice if elected. On the face of it it, it seems a dubious privilege anyhow; but I don't believe I would consider it as such. I want so much to help lift Iowa out of this situation. Despite a poor season and trying mental problems I have a pretty good time. Everything seems to be clearing up quite a bit and I am looking forward to many happy times after football - experiences, normal experiences, that I haven't enjoyed for several years. This year will see a much more equitable &amp; normal division of time between my rightful college activities.</full-text>

The consensus of opinion seems to point to Buck Shaw of Santa Clara - a former Stuart boy &amp; player at Notre Dame. I trust that I shall hear from you soon as to whether you are coming down for the Nebr. game. As for Thanksgiving - if you find it at all convenient I should like to meet you all in Adel.

               <full-text>November 15th, 1038 Dear SB: Another game lost in a heart-breaking manner when it seemed that you had it almost in the bag. From the data it appears that Indiana outplayed Iowa by a substantial margin and deserved to win. On the other hand, Iowa has several times in the past two years outplayed their opponents and still taken the small end of the score. One more contest to this season, and if you can turn these red shirted Nebraskans back it will be something to remark about. George and I were down to see the Panthers last Saturday and they, of course, clearly outclassed Nebraska, but don't fool yourself that the Jones Boys don't hear watching. They are a threat at anytime and you don't dare take your eyes off Rohrig and Dodd. They tried their old scoring play from kickoff but didn't quits get away with it; where Rohrig caught the kickoff deep  in the end of the field and started right up the center. Dodd was hanging around the 25 yard line and cut in from the side right behind Rohrig, angling slightly toward his own goal, receiving the ball from Rohrig and cutting toward the sideline with interference lining up in front of him. On this play there were three Huskers lined put nicely in front of him but he didn't quite catch up with them before some pitt man cut over and mowed him down. Probably Rollie has told you all about that, as I note that he scouted the game. Pitt made quite good gains thru Nebraska's line, but were most effective in running the ends. They started fast, ran hard and their interference, line and all, was effective. Usually twice into the line and then an end sweep from the same formation. I wish that you would write me immediately upon receipt of this letter whether or not you would care to have Ben and me come down for the Nebraska game. If you have other plans that will take your time, or if you would just prefer that we would not come, please state the case and we will be governed thereby. I am booked for a conference at Ame s on Monday and plan to come over Friday evening to Adel, transact some affairs on Grandma's farm and call on Judge Bradshaw Saturday morning. If we come to Iowa City, Ben will meet me in Des Moines and we will come down to IC about noon. If we do not come to IC I shall go up to see the Ames-Oklahoma game and stay over the Sunday with Ben.  If we come your way, I assume that you can get a pair of ducats for us. Perhaps mother has already written you, that plans are forming for our attendance at the Thanksgiving festivities in Adel. An appeal from Grandma has changed mother's mind on that point. Do we understand that you have only the one day off and must be back for classes on Friday? We believe that Ben has the balance of the week free, but I am not sure of that. Will you be  coming up to Adel for Thanksgiving and will you have a ride clear thru or shall we meet you in Des Moines or elsewhere? Love Pop</full-text>

            <FULLTEXT>November 15th, 1038 Dear SB: Another game lost in a heart-breaking manner when it seemed that you had it almost in the bag. From the data it appears that Indiana outplayed Iowa by a substantial margin and deserved to win. On the other hand, Iowa has several times in the past two years outplayed their opponents and still taken the small end of the score. One more contest to this season, and if you can turn these red shirted Nebraskans back it will be something to remark about. George and I were down to see the Panthers last Saturday and they, of course, clearly outclassed Nebraska, but don't fool yourself that the Jones Boys don't hear watching. They are a threat at anytime and you don't dare take your eyes off Rohrig and Dodd. They tried their old scoring play from kickoff but didn't quits get away with it; where Rohrig caught the kickoff deep  in the end of the field and started right up the center. Dodd was hanging around the 25 yard line and cut in from the side right behind Rohrig, angling slightly toward his own goal, receiving the ball from Rohrig and cutting toward the sideline with interference lining up in front of him. On this play there were three Huskers lined put nicely in front of him but he didn't quite catch up with them before some pitt man cut over and mowed him down.

               <full-text>November 16th, 1938 Dear SB: Again, very pleased to have your letter to-day and again, gratified to learn that you are not too much disturbed by the fortunes of Iowa's football. All would much rather have it reversed, as there is considerable satisfaction and a lot of pleasure in winning, at least part of the time. Iowa's experience is not far different that that of Ames during the time that I was there, when we never had a real team and hardly ever beat any outfit except Grinnell and Washington University (StL). We didn't have a lot ef talent until I was a senior, and then we beat Iowa for a change and that meant that the season was a reasonable success. But, as I have stated before. Football isn't the whole of college by any manner of means. You recognize that your experience has been fairly fruitful in spite of two poor seasons of football, and certainly it will continue to be if you maintain the balance that you now have pretty well established for yourself. Mother wrote you this afternoo n, she tells me, and from her comment I judge that has said substantially the same thing that have had in mind, about your prospects for the captaincy.  It has occured to me that at least you might be one of the candidates and may very likely be the choice. If so, I should accept it gladly and willingly with a firm resolve to do everything possible to swing Iowa's pendulum in the opposite direction. It also occured to me that the captain would be expected to lead in the spring practice. Your time there would not be lost and possibly you would find a lot of interest in it. I am highly in favor of staying right in there and pitching. I have always been a believer in finishing any task assumed and in doing the very best job possible. Should someone else be chosen, you of course will want to do all that you can in the interests of a successful reverse next fall, but I would guess that you might prefer baseball to spring practice. You made a remark in a recent letter that I have intended, to comment on, with emphasis. You said in regard to your next semester's tuition that you didn't know where it is coming from. Please set your busy mind at rest on that score as we can handle it without any concern on your part and we will make it a subject for our discussion when we meet. It will be good to be together again on Thanksgiving and I believe that there will not be many more such gatherings. Mother is struggling against so many excursions back to Adel, feeling that we should do more toward establishing ourselves here in Omaha. Only Grandma's plea changed mother(s mind this tine. I assume from a remark in to-day's letter that you are not adverse to Ben and me coming down Saturday. It would be a pleasure to see you give Nebraska the woiks. Love Pop</full-text>

               <full-text>December 2, 1938 Dear SB: Again much pleased to hear from you, and I believe that  Mother is also responding.  Your letters this fall have surely  Been all that we could ask, both in number, frequency and in spirit; reflecting a soundness and stability that have been highly pleasing to us. Of course we have followed the rapid sequence of events which has accompanied the change in coaches, and were glad to have your first impressions and to know that they are good.  Anderson  has a most impressive record, hasn't he? It would appear that a smart choice has been made, as I don't know where it can be  faulted, from the general point of view.  We noted that you took part in the ceremonies last Tuesday but have had no inkling of what was said until the Press-Cit came to-day and indicated that you included more of the University in your remarks than just the  football situation.  Justly so, and if our surmise is correct I  am happy that you did. Football is only a part, and probably too important at that. A splendid part, however, if held to a proper per spective, and I am happy that you have been able to keep it so close to that perspective.  You made a remark at Thanksgiving about publicity that interested me. Of course all of us get a kick out of favorable notice, but blessed be he who can forget it the next minute and not be warped and led astray.  There is where the danger lies.  Enjoy the fruits of victory, and the appreciation of ones friends is fine and a perfectly proper reward. But never get the idea that plaudits are stones out of which  victories are built.  Worse than sand, they are.  But you know  that.  I have an idea, as you say in your letter, that you are rather firmly established down there on a sound and right foundation and that you will continue to solidify it and will build higher thereon. We have had but one card from Ben since Thanksgiving And he still says the chemistry is leading him a merry chase.  It is about the first time that you have played that tune, about the accounting.  George probably could say the same about his arithmetic but he hasn't reached the point yet where it bothers him.  Mother is already moaning about next year's algebra at Benson. Yesterday I was in Fremont attending a meeting about government corn loans, as we probably will take some loans on Bank corn.  Next Wednesday I expect to be in Des Moines for a session on pastures; reviewing work that has been done in some central Iowa  counties during the past year. Mother may go along if arrangements for George's welfare can be made. Tomorrow afternoon I am driving up to Turin to see how the farm is coming along.  Mother plans to go along, if the weather is nice. To-day has been damp and foggy. Fondest love, my boy, and blessings attend you. Pop</full-text>

               <full-text>6  I saw the University dramatic dep't stage Maurice Maeterlink's "Bluebird." It was par excellence; highly enjoyable. If you are familiar with the play you can imagine how difficult it would be to produce it effectively. They have a wonderful little theater here - we must plan to see a play one of these years - all of us together.  As you have possibly guessed another interest has been added to my list - an interest that has been present a long while but pretty much in the shadow. Ah, woman that most beautiful of creatures has now entered into my college life. Woman clothed in all her beauty, charm and graciousness. That sounds very poetical</full-text>

               <full-text>December 13,  1938 Dear SB: Your very fine letter of Sunday found both mother and me in a receptive mood, which describes our usual mood with respect to your missives.    I might characterize this one as your best one of the year. When you get home I should like to use it as the outline for an evening's discussion, paragraph by paragraph.   You suggest that your questions might appear to us as naive or fantastic On the contrary, quite the opposite.    The entire thought of the letter bespeaks a splendid growth and development; a nice balance and appreciation; an alertness and interest, that will bear rich fruit for you, yours and your community  and country, one of these days.    I am sure that we shall have some grand discussions while you are home, and I am sorry that 1 will be away when you arrive,    My schedule takes me to Des Moines Thursday evening for a couple of days, attending a discussion of the 1939 ACP,    Then, Saturday afternoon I expect to look after my farms near Des Moines and spend Sunday doing the same for the Franklin County properties. After that week end endeavor I should not need again to visit those farms for several weeks. Ben has written that he will finish his last examination on the 21st, which is Wednesday of next week, and that he may be able to catch the 10:20 train for Omaha, arriving here about 4 o'clock PM. Mother at first planned to meet him and perhaps you, in Adel or Des Moines; but your ride home with   Ricardo and Ben's plans now make that trip unnecessary.    Also, mother now concludes to have our Christmas here, instead of at Wilbur's.   Grandma is not too well, as a cold appears to hang on with her. Probably you have given plenty of consideration to the point that I now raise,  in regard to the captaincy of the Iowa team for next year.    I understand that the President's dinner is on Wednesday night of this week,  or is it Thursday?    You should be in the running, and I hope you get it as I know of no one better qualified for the leadership.    But I do not know the setup as affected by fraternity politics, which may have considerable bearing.    If Prasse or someone else should as chosen, you will be the first to congratulate him I know, and will be pleased that the responsibility rests with him instead of you.   There are too many other things of interest and value to feel disconsolate over the outcome.  A fine honor, but not everything. Attached is a check for fifty bucks which you should place where it will serve you best, With fond love Pop</full-text>

               <full-text>JAMES W. FAY  LAWYER  December 31st, 1938.  Mr. Nile Kinnick,  5024 Hamilton,  Omaha,  H E B R.  Dear Nile:  I thought of writing this letter to you at the time I  sent a Christmas card, but thought it might be better  to wait.  I was both disappointed and surprised at the outcome of  the captaincy election.  However, that is life, and I  guess we have to face disappointments to really prove  our mettle.  With your flaming courage, brains, ability and physical  qualifications I know that you will carve your name  high in the football sky next year, and I want to be  one of the first to say I TOLD YOU 30!.'  The best of good luck and wishes, ALWAYS.  yours,  JWF-H. </full-text>

Substitutions were made in  wholesale fashion—several times  the entire lineup of one team being displaced in a single move.  ;•: Forward passes played a much  I more prominent part in the proceedings than has been the case  in  recent years.  From the material standpoint,  Iowa appeared to have its share  of backfield talent, although many  of the men are new. The ends,  from all appearances, will be exceptionally strong.

IOWA CITY, IA.—Coach Irl  Tubbs sent his Hawkeye gridmen  through the first scrimmage of  the season on a frigid practice  field Wednesday afternoon with  the regulars and seconds each  scoring a touchdown.  The scrimmage lasted only 20  minutes, but was a bruising exhibition of hard charging and  tackling with both teams packing  punch on offense.  The reserves drew first blood  when Glenn Olson, junior halfback, unable to pass, reeled off a  30-yard scoring run. A few moments later the regulars evened  the count after a sustained drive  with the veterans Lamb and Eich-  erly toting the ball.  Eicherly knifed through tackle  10 yards for the score.  Two sophomores we%e on the  sidelines Wednesday afternoon  with ' Charley horses. They were  Ed McLain, leading fullback prospect, and Fred Smith, 200-pound  Negro end from Cedar Rapids.  Both are expected to return in a  day or two. Balazs was also kept  out of the drill due to a lame  shoulder.  Two sophomores, Kinnick and  Dean, worked with LanA and  Eicherly in the regular backfield.  Luebcke was the only sophomore  in the line, the others being Harris and Lannon at the ends, De-  Heer and Farroh at the tackles,  Brady pairing with Luebcke at  guard, and Anderson at center.  The new backfield showed  speed in executing Tubbs' wing-  back formations and Eicherly appeared as a much improved ball  carrier and a fit running mate for  Lamb.

At quarterback will be|  ■Nile Kinnick, onetime Adel Highj,  ] school ace who seems destined to  shine in three sports before he  calls it quits. He's a standout in  football, basketball and baseball.  Kinnick is one of the coolest  youngsters to appear at Iowa in  some time. He's small, 160 pounds,  but he can throw that ball, put  his punts out of bounds at the  corners and lug the leather as well  as run the team.      Unless Bush  Lamb  can  convince   the   coaches  he's a better man than Kinnick,  the lanky Newton back will alter- :i  nate with Kinnick, or see service at i  left half.    Little Dick  Dobson  ofji  Sioux City looms as third quarterback.  The kicking problem will be  handled with some degree of satisfaction by Kinnick, Balazs, Lamb  and McLain. The same quartet,  along with Schenk, will fire most  of the passes. Best of the back-  field blocking may be expected  from Dean, Gallagher and McLain.  Omaha's Kinnick Iowa's Football Sophomore of the Year  The University of Iowa's Football Sophomore of the Year seems certain to be  Nile Kinnick, who began the game at Omaha's Benson High school under Ernest  Adams.  Kinnick started his collegiate career as first-string quaterback against Washington's Huskies at Seattle Saturday, was prominent in almost all the long gains  I  the Hawkeyes made, either as ball carrier or passer.  The Omaha boy chose Iowa over Iowa State, his father's alma mater, principally because of the opportuaity to play bigger-time baseball,, but he seems destined to become more famed for his gridiron talents than diamond  ability,  great  though it is  known  to be.—World-Herald  News Service Photos.   •* /	  Sees Improved Team.

Observations—I expect Iowa to!  be one of the noticeably improved  teams in the Big Ten conference  this season but not improved sufficiently to climb out of the see-}  ond   division.     The   odds   will   be)  against  the Hawkeyes  in five ofj  their eight games, with an outside!  chance for an even rating against i  i Wisconsin    and    Michigan.    The!

There isn't much I  of  a  drop  from  the  first  to  the  second  string,   according  to   indications.    The  schedule  is  severe.  Ability of the linemen from tackle  to   tackle   will    develop    rapidly [  enough to clear the way for the  Inexperienced  backs  is  the  basis  of Iowa's hopes.

Tubbs Drives Hawkeye  Gridders at Top Speed  IOWA CITY, IA.—The University of Iowa football team has  a good idea now of Irl Tubbs' method of coaching football.  Not a minute was wasted in two two-hour sessions Saturday,  the new Iowa coach keeping his boys alternating from one phase  of fundamental play to another, and demanding that they work  at top speed throughout the periods. Both of Saturday's drills  were given over mpstly to signal drills, with five complete  elevens running plays.  Although he has made no attempt to single out first string  players, Tubbs used Homer Harris and Erwin Prasse at the  ends on one team, Don Ludeman and Frank Gallagher at the  tackles, Charles Brady and Bob Herman at the guards and Fred  Lindenmeyer at center. The backfield on this eleven was composed of Nile Kinnick, quarterback, Al Schenk and Buzz Dean,  halfbacks, and Ed McLain, fullback.        Q—1£— jS"/  Kinnick at Quarter  on Hawkeye Varsity  (The World-Herald's Sports News Service.)  Iowa City, la., Sept. 15.—Coach  Irl    Tubbs    sent    his    Hawkeyes  through     the     first     scrimmage  Wednesday   on   a   frigid   practice  field with the regulars and seconds  each  getting  a  touchdown.    The  scrimmage   was   short   but   bruising and  both  teams appeared  to  pack considerable offensive power.  The   reserves  drew   first   blood  ! when Red Olson,  unable to pass,  ! ran with the ball for 40 yards and  I a score.    The regulars came back  j a few moments later with Eicherly  ind Lam. both veterans, leading a  sustained drive.  Kinnick called signals for the  regulars, with Dean, another sophomore, in the backfield. Luebcke  was the only sophomore in the  regular line. McLain, sophomore  back, and Fred Smith, soph end,  were kept out due to injuries.  ' Hawks Scrimmage  IOWA CITY. la.. Sept. 15, i/Pi—  Tlie University of I o w a football team got its first taste of  scrimmage here Wednesday afternoon under the best football  weather conditions for early practice in a number of years.  Coach Irl Tubbs sent what observers believed to be his first  two teams into the first hard contact, work since the practice  opened.  The Iowa mentor used Bob Lan-  non and Homer Harris at the ends  on the one team. Floyd Delieci  and Henry Luebcke at the tackles,  and Shipley Farroh and Chuck  Brady at the guards.

(The Register's Iowa News Service.)  IOWA CITY, IA.—Iowa's grid  squad came as close to scrimmaging as possible Tuesday in a pair  of passing and punting drills in  which the receivers were invariably brought to earth. According  to Hawkeye coaches, real scrimmage is in store for the gridmen  Wednesday when the running  game is expected to receive a careful overhauling.  Passing was done by a number  of players Tuesday, with Balazs.  Lamb and Kinnick doing much of  'h»   heaving.     The   kicking   game  !came  in  for the  usual attention.  Coach Irl Tubbs continued to shift  .his players frequently, and a first  string lineup is still in doubt. Kin-  jnick appears likely to get the call  as quarterback and McLain is being groomed for the fullback post,  jwith a pair of veterans, Lamb and  Schenk, making a fight for the  halfback posts along with Dean,  Atlantic sophomore.  The end situation appeared stable Tuesday with Harris and Lan-  non at' their usual posts, and  Lindenmeyer, a tackle last year,  has^cinched the reserve center  post temporarily, at least. Tubbs  continued to shuffle his guard and  tackle candidates, with DeHeer,  Luebcke, Frank Gallagher, Allen  Farroh and Ludemann all receiving attention.  The blocking and tackling appeared harder than at this time  last year in the passing drill, but  Line Coach Pat Boland closed both  practices with bruising jousts  with the charging and tackling  dummies.
