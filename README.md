# ContentDM-Mappings
This repository contains MODS files with mappings for the ContentDM-to-MODS crosswalk performed as a part of IRL's migration to Islandora.
# MODS Maps
MODS maps have filenames ending with the id of the collection they map for. All collections using these maps must have ids unique to the map collection.
# Alternate Digital File Maps
Alternate digital file maps (csv files) have filenames ending with the id of the collection they map for. For a collection not mapping in alternate files the `alt-file-map-null.csv` is to be used (and is supplied here).
# Samples
`mods-all-nodes.xml` is a MODS file containing what should be most of the nodes needed in a map for UIOWA collections being migrated. It's provided to base maps on.

| Collection | ID |
| ---------- | -- |
| Iowa City Town and Campus Scenes | ictcs |
| John P. Vander Maas Railroadiana | rr |
| Nile Kinnick Collection | (to come) |
